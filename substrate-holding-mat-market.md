<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Substrate Holding Mat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intumescent Substrate Support Mat</li><li>Non-Intumescent Substrate Support Mat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intumescent Substrate Support Mat is a type of substrate holding mat that expands when exposed to high temperatures, creating a protective barrier to prevent fire spread. It is commonly used in construction and industrial applications where fire protection is required. On the other hand, Non-Intumescent Substrate Support Mat does not expand when heated and primarily provides support for substrates without offering fire protection. Both types of mats play a critical role in ensuring the integrity and safety of structures.</p></p>
