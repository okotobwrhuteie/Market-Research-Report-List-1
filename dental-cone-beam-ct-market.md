<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Cone Beam CT Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Large FOV</li><li>Medium FOV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental Cone Beam CT Market Types consist of two main categories: Large Field of View (FOV) and Medium Field of View (FOV). Large FOV machines provide a wider imaging area, allowing for full dental arch scans and complete views of the jaw. These are commonly used for complex oral surgeries. Medium FOV machines offer a narrower imaging area, suitable for specific dental procedures like implant planning or endodontic treatment. Both types offer high-quality 3D images and precise diagnostics for improved patient care.</p></p>
