<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The On Board Driver Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active DMS</li><li>Passive DMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active Driver Monitoring System (DMS) involves real-time monitoring of the driver's behavior and alerting them if it detects signs of fatigue or distraction. This system actively intervenes to prevent accidents by issuing warnings or taking control of the vehicle autonomously. On the other hand, Passive DMS collects data on the driver's behavior and provides insights after the fact, without actively intervening. Both types of systems play a crucial role in enhancing road safety and reducing accidents caused by human errors.</p></p>
