<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conformal Coating Strippers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conformal Coating Remover Gel</li><li>Conformal Coating Remover Pen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conformal Coating Strippers come in two main types: Conformal Coating Remover Gel and Conformal Coating Remover Pen. Remover gel is a thick substance that can be applied directly to the coated surface and left to dissolve the conformal coating. Remover pen, on the other hand, is a more precise tool that allows for targeted application of the stripping agent. Both types are effective in removing conformal coatings from electronic components, but offer different application methods for varying needs.</p></p>
