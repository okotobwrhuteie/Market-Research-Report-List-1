<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Raman Optical Amplifiers (DRA) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Raman</li><li>Post Raman</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distributed Raman Optical Amplifiers (DRA) can be classified into two market types: Pre-Raman and Post-Raman. In Pre-Raman DRA, the optical signal is amplified before reaching the transmission line, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and extending the reach of the signal. On the other hand, in Post-Raman DRA, the optical signal is amplified after it has traveled a certain distance, allowing for compensating signal loss and improving the overall performance of the transmission system. Both types play essential roles in enhancing optical communication networks.</p></p>
