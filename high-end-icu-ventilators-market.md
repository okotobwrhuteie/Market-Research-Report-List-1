<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-end ICU ventilators market consists of two main types: invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves inserting a tube into the patient's airway to deliver oxygen, making it suitable for patients with severe respiratory failure. On the other hand, non-invasive ventilation provides respiratory support without the need for intubation, making it a less invasive option for patients with less severe respiratory issues. Both types play a crucial role in providing life-saving respiratory care in the ICU setting.</p></p>
