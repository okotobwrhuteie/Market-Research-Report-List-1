<p><strong>The Pulp Moulding Egg Tray Making Machinery Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Large Farm (Laying Hen above 100 K Units)</li><li>Small and Medium-sized Farm (Laying Hen less than 100 K Units)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pulp moulding egg tray making machinery is used in both large and small/medium-sized farms for the production of egg trays. Large farms with over 100 thousand laying hens require high-capacity machinery to meet their large-scale production needs. On the other hand, small and medium-sized farms with fewer than 100 thousand laying hens can benefit from smaller, more versatile machinery to produce egg trays on a smaller scale. Both types of farms rely on this machinery for efficient and cost-effective packaging solutions.</p></p>
