<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Viscosity</li><li>Medium Viscosity</li><li>High Viscosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Epoxy bonding agents are classified into three types based on their viscosity: low, medium, and high. Low viscosity bonding agents are highly fluid and penetrate deep into the substrate, making them suitable for bonding porous surfaces. Medium viscosity bonding agents strike a balance between flowability and gap-filling capabilities, making them versatile for various applications. High viscosity bonding agents are thick and have strong gap-filling properties, making them ideal for vertical or overhead applications where the material needs to stay in place.</p></p>
