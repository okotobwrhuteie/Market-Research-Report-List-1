<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The KrF Resist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive KrF Resist</li><li>Negative KrF Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>KrF resist market types are determined by the material's response to KrF wavelength radiation used in photolithography processes. Positive KrF resist becomes more soluble when exposed to KrF radiation, making it suitable for creating features on substrates. In contrast, negative KrF resist becomes less soluble when exposed, allowing for the formation of protective layers. Positive KrF resist is commonly used for patterning while negative KrF resist is employed for processes requiring etching or lift-off techniques.</p></p>
