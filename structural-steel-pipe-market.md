<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Steel Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spiral Weld Pipe</li><li>Double Submerged Arc Weld (DSAW)</li><li>Electric Resistance Weld (ERW)</li><li>Seamless (SMLS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Structural steel pipe market can be classified into four main types: Spiral Weld Pipe, Double Submerged Arc Weld (DSAW), Electric Resistance Weld (ERW), and Seamless (SMLS). Spiral Weld Pipe is produced by bending and welding a steel strip in a spiral to create a sturdy pipe. DSAW involves submerging welded seams in a flux to produce a strong connection. ERW pipes are made through continuous roll-forming and welding processes. SMLS pipes are created from a solid round steel billet that is heated and pierced to form a seamless tube.</p></p>
