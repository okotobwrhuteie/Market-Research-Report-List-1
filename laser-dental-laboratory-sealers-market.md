<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Dental Laboratory Sealers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sealers</li><li>Micro-sealers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser dental laboratory sealers are devices used to seal dental prosthetics like crowns and bridges. They come in two main types: sealers and micro-sealers. Sealers are larger devices that use laser technology to effectively seal the prosthetic materials, ensuring a tight fit. Micro-sealers, on the other hand, are smaller and more precise devices that target specific areas of the dental prosthetic for sealing. Both types of sealers help in creating durable and long-lasting dental restorations for patients.</p></p>
