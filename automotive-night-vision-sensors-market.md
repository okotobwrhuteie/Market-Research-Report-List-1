<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Night Vision Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Far Infrared (FIR) Automotive Night Vision Sensors</li><li>Near Infrared (NIR) Automotive Night Vision Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Night Vision Sensors are of two types - Far Infrared (FIR) and Near Infrared (NIR). FIR sensors detect heat signatures emitted from objects, allowing drivers to see clearly in complete darkness or through obstacles like smoke or fog. On the other hand, NIR sensors use infrared light to illuminate the road ahead, providing visibility in low light conditions. Both types of sensors enhance driver safety by improving visibility and detecting potential obstacles on the road at night.</p></p>
