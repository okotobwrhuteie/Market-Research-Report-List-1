<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diet Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soluble Diet Fiber</li><li>Insoluble Diet Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diet fiber can be classified into two main types: soluble and insoluble. Soluble diet fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance in the digestive tract, which helps to slow down digestion and promote feelings of fullness. This type of fiber can also help to lower cholesterol levels and regulate blood sugar levels. On the other hand, insoluble diet fiber does not dissolve in water and adds bulk to the stool, promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. Both types of fiber are essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system.</p></p>
