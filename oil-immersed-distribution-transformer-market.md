<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-immersed Distribution Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Three-phase</li><li>Single-phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil-immersed distribution transformers are classified into two main types based on the number of phases they have: three-phase and single-phase. Three-phase transformers have three sets of primary and secondary windings, making them suitable for larger power distribution networks. They are more commonly used for industrial and commercial applications. On the other hand, single-phase transformers have only one primary and one secondary winding, making them ideal for residential and small commercial applications. They are typically used for lower power requirements and lighter loads.</p></p>
